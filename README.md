> silly little project of mine i created because i was bored.
> since this is first time i was working on html css and javascript i decided to follow a 2 hour tutorial and then build on top of that by adding some little animations and improving overall quality. so far it looks good, at least to me.
> really don't know what else to write here since this is my literal first project in github.

> tutorial i followed : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OqWCGVaOkA
